The Mathmatica code (mul_prox_st_sor_commented.nb) the reads in glaciological mass balance and proxy time series for Saint-Sorlin Glacier (from data_st_sorlin.txt) and produces the multiproxy reconstruction (outputs go to mulprox_outputs_st_sor.txt; the data columns are described in the mathematica file). The mathematica file include detailed comments. The geodetic data is hard coded in the mathematica file.
